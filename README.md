NFA-->DFA: This Python program converts a Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) into a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) using the subset construction method. It supports creating NFAs, computing epsilon closures, performing the conversion, and visualizing the resulting DFA as a graph.

CFG: This Python script implements a Context-Free Grammar (CFG) Parser that converts a CFG into Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and parses user input strings to check if they can be derived from the given grammar.
